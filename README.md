[Sprinklers-PHP](http://salbahra.github.io/OpenSprinkler-Controller)
========================

A mobile interface for the OpenSprinkler irrigation device. Designed to allow manual control, program management (view, edit, delete and add), initiation of a run-once program, viewing device status, adjusting rain delay, viewing logs, and changing of OpenSprinkler settings. Screenshots available below.

Overview:
---------

+ This application interfaces with the interval program on the OpenSprinkler which is the default software available. The application has been tested on firmware version 2.0.0 but should be compatible with 1.8.x and newer.

+ There is an authentication system in place and a guide on first run will assist in adding a new user along with any other required settings.

+ The provided interface does not rely on the javascript files hosted by Ray therefore will work on a locally hosted server even without an internet connection (with the local asset option enabled, which is disabled by default). However an internet connection (with a properly configured web server and port forwarding) will allow you to access the application from anywhere.

+ The application is written in PHP, Javascript, and HTML/CSS. This means a web server is required. Any web server supporting PHP should be supported. The default install instructions use Apache (default for most installs).

+ For current discussion about the project please refer to the [forum post](http://rayshobby.net/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=154).
